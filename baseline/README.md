## Baseline Model: Canny Edge Detector

### Brief Overview
Since we are focused on object segmentation, our team decided to implement a classical computer vision algorithm called the Canny Edge Detector as our baseline model. First developed by John Canny in 1986, the Canny Edge Detector worked towards improving on existing edge detection techniques by addressing issues such as noise sensitivity, issues with response rate, and edge localization. Now, the Canny Edge Detector is a widely used tool in many computer vision tasks for its efficient and accurate edge detection.

Prior to deep learning, edge detection was essential in tasks such as boundary detection, and the early stages of image segmentation. Even with the onset of deep learning, edge processing is often used as an initial step to image segmentation. For these reasons, we have chosen to implement the Canny Edge Detector as a baseline to compare with our project.
